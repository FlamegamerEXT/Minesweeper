# Minesweeper
A version of the game Minesweeper made in Processing (Java).
Once a game is won or lost, clicking on the 'New Game' restarts the game at the selected difficulty.

CONTROLS:
 - Left click on mines to uncover them
 - Right click on mines to mark/unmark them
 - Click on buttons to use them
   - The 'New Game' buttons restart the game with the appropriate level of difficulty
   - The 'AI' button generates hints based on the visible board state, and can uncover or mark
     spaces appropriately when clicked again. (WARNING: Generating hints may take several seconds,
     depending on the number of points that are not easy to figure out are safe or unsafe)
